    "In this lesson, we will discuss the orbits of spacecraft and planets, and how those orbits can be affected by another body flying by.  We will look at Encke's method, which was created by _____ in _____, and uses an ODE to describe the \"new\" orbit of a body when affected by the pull of an additional body flying by.\n",

    "These orbits play a large role in our daily lives.  There are numerous satelittes currently orbiting Earth as we speak, which are used for communications, GPS, as well as other data grabbers.  These satelittes can have slight changes to their orbits around Earth caused by other satelittes and need to be taken into consideration when designing orbital parameters for them."
